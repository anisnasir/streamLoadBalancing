Please follow mentioned steps to execute the simulator
1. Pre-processing
	- make sure that you have added required maven dependencies
	- Twitter data has some tweets with null text. Simulator does not accepts tweets with null text. use
		cat twitter|grep -P '^[0-9]*\t[a-z].*'>twitter
	- Wiki data has issue with ordering of timestamps, i.e., some keys are out of order
		make sure that you catch the exceptions in the Server.java in updateStats and addTranscation method
	- Wiki data has multiple spaces between timestamp and url. Remember to replace multiple spaces with tabs

2. Execution
	- Use the run_simulation.sh script to run the simulator
3. Post processing
	- use the matlab script inside src/main/matlab to generate the graphs
